Scientists have long studied the brain’s neural pathways in an attempt to better understand what drives human behavior; from the instinctual sensation of connecting with someone at first glance, to intense hatred for another individual. Today's podcast will explore these phenomena, as we investigate the neuroscience behind our evolutionary circuitry – specifically looking at how neural paths may be responsible for human connection and hatred. Join us on this exploration into understanding what lies deep beneath our conscious brains as we search for answers surrounding humanity’s powerful programming towards one another.</p><p>Web: <a href=""http://billieatoms.com"">billieatoms.com</a> </p><p>Shop: <a href=""https://billionsofatoms.org"">https://billionsofatoms.org</a></p>"
